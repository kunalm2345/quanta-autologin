Logging into Quanta is too annoying. This little Chrome Extension automates this.

## How to install
1. Download this from Code > Download as ZIP
2. Unzip it
3. Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
4. Enable “Developer mode” by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
5. Click on “Load unpacked” and select the folder where you unzipped the extension files.
6. The extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.
